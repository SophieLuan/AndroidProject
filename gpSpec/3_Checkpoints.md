# Checkpoints

Present your stage of development to a tutor and get some quick feedback! You must sign up for a session (for checkpoint 1) and attend your lab (for checkpoint 2). The full team should try to attend checkpoint 1 together, but for checkpoint 2, only ONE member attending is fine.

## Expectations
For both checkpoints, bring your laptop(s) and have your project ready to be shown (i.e., with your Gitlab repository open and the project loaded on Android Studio). Most of your completed work should be visible on your Git repository, not scattered across different membersâ€™ local projects.<br>

### Checkpoint 1 (W7/8, about 40% of the project time has passed):
- have a **schedule of development activities**, and consistent progress (shown in the Git history) 
- the **roles** of each member, and tasks distribution <u>(basic tasks evenly distributed</u> to all members)
- at least **one meeting minute** committed to the repository
- A (thought-through) planned structure of your code (code skeleton in your project or UML) 
- completed the basic features or have **substantial** progress
- Completed registration on [Wattle](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/mod/groupselect/view.php?id=3226220) (all members registered, and included the URL to your repository before start of checkpoint 1).

### Checkpoint 2 (W10, 1 week left):
- App almost fully implemented: has a working App ready for presentation (an APK or emulated)
- a **reasonable draft of the report** with some content (minimum: **design decisions**)
- at least **three meeting minutes**
- a documented plan clearly showing how to complete the remaining tasks before the deadline (the plan can be part of a meeting minute held before your checkpoint)
<br>


Every customer wants to know how the software is progressing. Here it is the same: you need to show that the app is being developed and that you will meet the deadline. **Missing a checkpoint will result in a 5-mark reduction in your final grade (you missed an important meeting!)**.

Besides those mandatory checkpoints, you may feel free to ask questions during the post-lab 
consultations (for technical questions only). For clarification or approval on any part of 
the assignment, please feel free to post your questions on Ed.

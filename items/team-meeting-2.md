## Team Meeting 2 - Week 8 - 2024-09-29 (17:00-18:00)
**Absent:** 0
<br>
**Lead:** Lujin Sun, Zhengyu Peng

## Agreed Procedure
Stand up Procedure: 
- First, each of us briefly explained the progress of our tasks from the previous stage. Due to the update of the Log function, Ziang Wang's work on UI design also requires further modification, and he will need to continuously adjust and update the UI in the upcoming tasks. Lujin Sun's datastream design is not yet fully completed, but he said he could finish it by tonight. So, the design of the basic features for the first stage has come to an end for now.
- Then, the group members discussed the subsequent designs and clarified that we need to complete around five more challenging features in total, but only 2 to 3 need to be done this week. 
- After analyzing and discussing the list one by one, we decided to first add the search and post features to the app. The search feature is more complex and will be completed by Lujin, Ziang, and Zhizhao together, while the post feature will be done by Zhengyu and Xuefei together.
- Next, we had a detailed discussion about future arrangements. For the non-code part of the final submission, we agreed that we need to prepare early and start accumulating materials as soon as possible. For the code part, we must clarify the key points early on and try to avoid going back for modifications after completion, aiming for one-time perfection.
- Finally, we adjourned the meeting after agreeing on the code submission deadline and the time for the next meeting.

## Team Meeting 1 - Week 7 - 2024-09-22 (20:00-20:47)
**Absent:** 0
<br>
**Lead:** Lujin Sun, Zhengyu Peng

## Agreed Procedure
Stand up Procedure: 
- Zhengyu Peng said that there are two ways to think about the selection of app themes. First, if you find a topic of interest related to smart cities, then choose this topic. Another way to think about it is that if there are features you want to implement, you can list the features first. See what topics you can choose if you need to meet these features.
- Xuefei Luan found relevant data about the Community Task Manager application. This application is a platform for city residents to coordinate and collaborate on community improvement tasks (such as community cleaning, event organization, and volunteer work).
- Through discussion, based on the data set found by Xuefei Luan, the team members gradually determined the features that can be implemented. These features include peer-to-peer messaging, displaying detailed information about upcoming or ongoing community tasks, real-time updates on task progress, and feedback on ongoing tasks through notifications or progress updates.
- The team members proposed the features that they planned to complete. Among them, Zhengyu Peng completed the LogIn interface; Xuefei Luan completed DataFiles; Zhizhao Sun completed LoadShowData; Ziang Wang completed UXUI, UI-Layout; Lujin Sun completed DataStream.
- Finally, Zhengyu Peng proposed matters that need to be paid attention to in the process of completing the project. The team members reviewed the Assessment and General Policies in the Appendices_Rubrics.md file, including Assessment Rubrics and Marking Criteria. During the discussion, each team member answered questions raised by other team members.
- The meeting also discussed other matters.

Conflict Resolution Protocol

To ensure smooth progress and effective collaboration throughout our project, our team agrees on the following procedures to handle conflicts or unforeseen challenges. The goal is to maintain team cohesion, meet project deadlines, and ensure fair contribution from all members.
1. A member is sick in the final week of the project:

   Action Plan: If a member becomes sick during the final week, and their illness prevents them from fully participating, the team will divide their tasks among other members to ensure the work is completed.
   Remote Participation: If the sick member can contribute remotely (e.g., through video recordings), we will facilitate their involvement by incorporating their work into presentations or demonstrations. If they wish to participate despite being unwell, the team will request additional consideration from the teaching staff for their effort.
   Fair Credit: The team will ensure that the sick member receives fair credit for the work they contributed, and any missing contribution will be discussed with the instructor if necessary.

2. A member did not complete the assigned task before a checkpoint:

   Immediate Solution: The team will step in to collaboratively complete any unfinished tasks to avoid missing the checkpoint. The priority is the overall project and the team’s performance.
   Evaluation of Contribution: If the situation arises due to genuine reasons (e.g., unexpected workload or difficulty), we will reassign responsibilities more appropriately, assigning simpler but necessary tasks to the struggling member.
   Adjusting Contribution: In cases where the delay was avoidable, the member's contribution will be adjusted accordingly. However, we will provide additional support to help them improve their performance for future tasks.

3. A member is unreachable for over two days:

   Initial Follow-Up: If a member is unresponsive for two days without prior notice or a valid reason, the team will attempt to reach them through multiple channels (e.g., email, messaging apps, or direct contact).
   Reassignment of Tasks: If they remain unreachable, their tasks will be reassigned to other members to ensure deadlines are met.
   Reporting the Issue: If the member does not provide a valid reason or this behavior repeats, the team will escalate the issue to the instructor, with a vote to determine whether to reduce their contribution or potentially remove them from the team.
   Clear Communication: We will make it clear to all members that maintaining communication is critical, and that repeated unresponsiveness will result in reduced responsibility and marks.

4. Different understandings of the assignment requirements:

   Consulting the Instructor: In the case of differing interpretations of the project requirements, the team will first consult the teaching staff for clarification to avoid misunderstandings.
   Internal Discussion: If the disagreement persists, the team will discuss the issue openly, presenting all perspectives.
   Voting: If consensus is not reached, the team will hold a democratic vote to decide which interpretation to follow, ensuring that the decision reflects the majority view.
   Documentation: All decisions related to understanding project requirements will be documented for future reference to avoid repeated confusion.

5. General Principles:

   Respectful Communication: All team members are expected to communicate with respect and professionalism, even in times of disagreement or stress.
   Timely Updates: Each member should keep the team updated on their progress regularly, and notify the team immediately if any issues arise that could delay their tasks.
   Equal Contribution: We aim to distribute tasks fairly, but adjustments may be made based on each member’s skills, availability, and workload.

By adhering to these protocols, we can efficiently manage conflicts and maintain a productive, positive team environment. If any additional situations arise that are not covered by this protocol, the team will address them using the same principles of collaboration, fairness, and open communication.
